### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

I am a self-taught frontend developer from Brno, Czech Republic with over 4 years of professional experience. In my short career I've had the opportunity to work with many different web technologies such as React, Vue.js, Redux, TypeScript, Gatsby.js, Next.js and many others. I have also worked with some backend technologies such as Node.js and Java on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working mostly with JAMstack sites built with React (Gatsby.js or Next.js) and using Kontent by Kentico headless CMS as a backend

ðŸŒ± Currently learning C# with .NET and Azure
