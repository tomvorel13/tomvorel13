### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

I am a self-taught frontend developer from Brno, CzechiaðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ with over 3 years of professional experience. In my short career I've had the opportunity to work with many different web technologies such as React, Vue.js, Redux, TypeScript (still in the process of being 100% comfortable with it), Gatsby.js, Next.js and many others. I have also worked with some backend technologies such as Node.js and Java on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working mostly with JAMstack sites built with Gatsby.js and using Kontent by Kentico headless CMS as a backend

ðŸŒ± Currently learning C# with .NET and Azure
